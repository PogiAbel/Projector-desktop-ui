# Projector-desktop

This is a minimalist alternative for the [Projector](https://github.com/bence21/Projector) application that can be downloaded from [songpraise.com](https://www.songpraise.com/#/desktop-app)

The main problem is that the **Projector** app is windows exclusive(and has terrible compatibility with linux wine).

This project could be run in any desktop that supports Python.(maybe there will be builds in the future)

This is mainly in development but already somewhat useable.
(If you want to use the current version you need to download an sqlite database from [here](https://www.ph4.org/b4_index.php) and put it in the databse folder, also change the database name to the downloaded file in database/bible.py line 47)

Goals:

- [ ] Custom dowloadable bible databases
- [ ] Song downloads
- [ ] Create custom songs
- [ ] Screen managment

As this is a project for my needs it will contain only the minimum I need and will not implement everything from the Projector app.
